# 4-22
9-9.5: trim. need to be more strict about argument placement and trimming
10.5-11:

# 7-03
14-15.5:trim, adding explanatory logs
16-17:trim, tracking down fixed point deviations
21-22:tracking down fixed point deviations, 

strings need to be re-worked, since strings and character classes are distinct.
Arguably though, they are a special form of Sequence and Choice over Char

# 7-03
9.5-11: separate string from character class
11.5-13.5: separate string from character class, testBuildMath


# todo
* optim: make sure that trim isn't doing extraneous work
* optim: clean up parser internals to make them easier to reason about and port
